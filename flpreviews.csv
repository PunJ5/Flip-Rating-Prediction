309,Nice,"Honest Suggestion From a Student and Office Going Person.

Pros -
1. Its fast, No doubt.
2. Upgradability.
- Ram Can be upgraded upto 12GB from 4GB. Using empty Slot at 3200mhz.
- There is 256GB M.2 Nvme SSD in the Laptop. But you can upgrade that as well. Using Nvme or Pcie any SSD in that Slot.
Also there is 1 other empty HDD/SATA SSD Slot available for further Upgradability.
3. Lifetime of MS Office 2019 and Win 10/11. Just always remember Microsoft ID PS. Cause its linked to it only.

Go to power Settings and Advanced and reduce the CPU usage to 80%.(while gaming)

Also Try to play Game on Max settings possible for you with 50-60fps.That will really help you maintain CPU temperature around 60-65¬∞c

1462,Delightful,The laptop is great and can provide a maximum of 144 fps even with a 3050 rtx because of other limitations. The web cam is not that good but so if you need to attend calls with this then probably not the best choice. For gaming purposes although it's good but it often heats upto 55-70¬∞ during gaming.,4
1463,Classy product,"Great laptop. Bought it for 63k on sale. Cpu's great. Gpu could have been better if it used more than 40 watt. Battery not great. 3 hour backup on all battery saving options on. It's using hynix 8gB 3200mhz ram which is sadly clocked at 2933mhz. Bought another 3200mhz 8gB ram for it. It has kingston nvme m.2 ssd. Don't know why fps is low on valorant. Avg -140 fps. Intel has done a good job on this 10500h cpu. It took me 2 hours and 6 minutes to install Red dead redemption 2 (DODI repack). Ov...

1464,Great Purchase,"Been using for almost 10 hours right now. Satisfied with the performance but the fans are noisy when you're using GPU too much, like I was testing the raytracing with Minecraft
for raytracing and the fan sound went very high, Otherwise it's a great purchase.",4
1465,Classy product,Best laptop in both price and perfermance. In 63k it was really a very good opportunity to buy this during big billion days. Really RTX 3050 gives a beast power to this. Finally happy to buy this.,5
1466,Brilliant,The laptop is good in this price point of 62k. The performance is really good....everything is good except the battery. At battery saver mode also it cannot work for more than 2 hours.....so always have to hook with the power plug.,5
1467,Awesome,"One of the best laptop at this price range.
144hz will nail it. Battery backup is normal. Can't expect more on gaming laptop with these awesome features. Cooling is awesome in this. Once it gets heat it will get cool soo quick. Graphics are ultimate in this. Weight is good. Performance is overall awesome üî•",5
1468,Terrific purchase,"Gifted this to my brother and touchwood its going fine till now. Hopefully everything is well as of now, was really sceptic as i have never placed anything online that too an expensive thing. Well done flipcart",5
1469,Worth every penny,"Amazing laptop at a good budget price point
Pros
1. Great display, 144hz really brings out the crispness in image quality
2. Rtx 3050, this is a powerful GPU that was able to run cyberpunk 2077 at high settings
3. i5 10500H is powerful processors and can handle all games easily

Cons
Ram is only 8 gb, at 65k they could have given us 16 or 12 gb ram
Processors heat up to 85 and sometime 89 celsius",5
1470,the best laptop you could get for 63k.....just go for it,"the performance is smooth and the compact form factor is awesome,easy poratability.
very good for playing csgo,valorant and dota 2
u could add extra ssd and ram from msi service centre only,orelse the warranty will be voided
register the product at msi website as soon as u get the hands on it
screen is awesome,sound is good
heat dissipation is decent
40 watt tgpu rtx 3050....performs more than expected
simply go for it and save some extra bucks",5
1471,Great product,"Best laptop for the price. Very good performance and thermal management.
The cinebench score is very good.
Geekbench score is also good
Ssd speed is very fast
Games run very smooth, thanks to the RTX 3050

Overall, this is unbelievable at its price range
I will give a 5/5 in every way.
This is a ""PORTABLE-POWERHOUSE-PERFORMER""",5

1474,Just wow!,I loved this laptop the performance is really amazing with so low price. I am using this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and till now i haven't encounter any problem the rtx 3050 even though 40w performs really well,5
1475,Value-for-money,"I bought this at 58K during BBD sale, and it justified the price.
In the said price range, it is very competetive and affordable machine. I'll list the areas which I feel could be improved later in the review.

1. 144HZ monitor - Awesome
2. It is very light
3. Build Quality is OK, does not feel cheap.
4. Thermals - As soon as CPU Temp reaches 80, it comes down automatically. Same is for gpu too, but the temperature threshold for GPU is above 80 degree Celsius. Heat will not be noticed while p...

Update after a month:
The battery back up is pathetic. It's really worrying often times. If I run Fifa with the best settings, the battery hardly lasts an hour. Otherwise it's a steal. Really need to figure out something for it. Appreciate any tips if you have.",4

1994,Most powerful laptop under 65K,"I've been using this laptop from past 1 week and here are some pros and cons that I came across while using this laptop-

1. Display- Display is pretty decen according to the price as every laptop in this price range uses same kind of LCD display if you are going to use this laptop for photo or video editing where color accuracy is really important then you have to buy an exernal monitor or you have to go with higher end laptop which give 100% sRGB value. For my usage I find this display good...

1. The battery life is good for such a machine. Im getting around 5 hours while normal browsing and simple tasks. Amd ryzen5 is a 7nm chip so less power consumption.
2. The display is good and you wont feel anything unless you go nick picking the faults. Yes the colour accuracy isnt great, but one wont notice in regular usage.
3. Good thermals. Doesn't heat up unnecessary under normal usage.

Battery life is good and charging time will be more as this is good for gaming laptop.
Gta v COD Fortnite Cyberpunk 2077 I played these games in this lap performance is super no lag constant 60fps with 2k resolution
Lap body catches fingerprint over it easily so you need to rub it with cloth
Such a good heat dissipation they made in this lap
Some speed lag you may see if you used a pure ssd lap when launching the apps but not bad only a milli second delay",5

But battery life of gaming laptops are not that good everybody knows. It has two variants , the 1650ti will cost you 66k which i think is not worth it, because 1650ti has a very slight performance difference as compare to 1650.

But the mic is powerful. Definitely a value for money product.

Very bright and good colors . And performance was damn good even in 2k 120hz settings valorant runs avg around 90 - 110 fps in high and medium settings.

But the only problem is after updating to windows 11 the finger print doesn't recognise sometime like 3 out of 10 times.",4
5088,Awesome,"Amazing Laptop and the fact that this model have 1440p and 120hz display , i loved it, bought this over other gaming laptop because of light weight and battery life, easily 10hrs of battery life on normal use, no compromise on performance front.

there are only two things i missed on this laptop and that are Webcam and Ethernet port.

Only cons
1. Battery : it is not much efficient, draining quite fast i f you running the fan at high speed and doing tasks.
2. Hinge - Its not super sturdy. In case of a light movement, the screen will wobble a bit. But if your task is more on stable surface, its good to go.

Apart from it, i would say everything is fantastic. Go for it.",5

It's has a large display that you can watch movies play games just experience like a gaming PC. It has absolutely ultra smooth display of 90Hz refresh rate . I love this phone. INFINIX is know what we need.
But it has a demerit of HD+ display but it's not so big deal. I have run PUBG Mobile around 8 hours non-stop and the battery still left 15% if buy this phone you will not regret yourself.

8597,Nice product,"Everything is good except auto call recording. Needs to update the features on this.
Pros:
Fantastic battery backup, very good front and rear cameras, fast processing of apps without lag, crystal clear sound quality
Cons:
Bad auto call recording facility",4
8598,Fabulous!,"Very good at the price tag
Good performance, no lags no hang ups
Camera is good, but it should have been much better if provided with wide angle camera
And sound quality is good, but it would be good if it is equipped with stereo speakers

90 Hz refresh rate makes it good for all types of work
The gaming experience is awesome, as usual heats a bit if played more than an hour",5

But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.,5

11028,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
11029,Good choice,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4

11573,Nice,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3

True Feedback after 2 months of use.
Pros:- 6000 mah battery
6.5'' display
Con's:- Bad Processor, very cheap
Bulky
Poor camera 8 mp is better than this Samsung claims 48 but in one specific mode no zoom.low light performance horrible.
I won't recommend this phone to people out there.",3

11582,Hated it!,"The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

1. It is future ready - already has 5G support
2. Reasonably priced
3. Big screen - 6.5"", big storage (128 GB) and big battery - 5000mah
4. Type C charger 18W, better than microUSB but could have been better as far as 18W is concerned
5. 3.5 mm jack is there for wired earphones/headphones
6. The box already has back cover and seems 1 layer of screen protection is also there.
7. Camera clarity is good both selfie and back camera - haven't explored features like macro, slowmo, panorama ...

12056,Super!,I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.,5

Display is awesome, 90 hz actually works. Viewing angles are also good and there is no colour shift.

Battery takes about 2 hrs to charge from 20-100% and lasts 1 day easily and 1.25 days when u turn on power marathon. Warms little bit but no overheat...

12889,Best in the market!,"I switched from an iPhone 6s to a 12 mini and the difference is incredible. Before buying the 12 mini, the two complaints I heard most often from reviewers were about low battery life and the lack of a 120 Hz display.

13121,Value-for-money,"Nice phone by realme.
Camara quality is too good in this price range and display also. Battery performance is good but not best. Phone performance good for normal working like editing, social working and much more. But not for gaming like BGMI, CODM, Free fire. Processor (G-95) got heated during playing game. Overall good performance in this price range. If you see gaming device in this price range go for POCO X3 PRO(SD860)",4
13122,Very Good,"ALthough the product has some drawbacks, it is the best in this price range with a fairly good camera. One of the main cons I feel about this is it get delayed at times eventhough it has a 6gb ram. but still it has great power efficiency and is fair enough to be called fast charge. i love this product.",4

I have got 113gb storage in 128gb. Awesome model üòäüòä",4
13125,Awesome,"Works absolutely fine. Is even good looking. Dual-Sim & dedicated SD Card slot. Been using it for 7 days.
Battery is not superb but is decent. Atleast it charges fast enough to make up for its slightly reduced vitality.
For 14-15k you get a lot of features in this phone. Heating issues minimal.",5
13126,Terrific purchase,Best product for the budget under 15000. I am using this phone from last 20 days and their is no problem at all the sound quality is best but the battery and the charging support is best in this phone There is a 30 Watts Dart charger which charge 0 to 100 percent in almost 70 minutes. I advice people's whose budget is lower than 15000 to buy this phone this is a very good product in this range.,5

13128,Good quality product,"45 days after purchase:-
Go for the phone if performance is a priority for you. You'll be going to take some beating at camera and screen quality (but it's decent enough),90 fps is great for bgmi. Go for the 128/6 GB version,as it's the cheapest in the segment. Conclusion:- If you like you're phone to be non laggy,fast switching between apps,great gaming experience, decent fast charging (30W charger charges 0-100 in 70 mins),and good battery backup,and you're not a camera person who likes to ...

Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people.",1

It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.

14716,Good choice,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it.

14718,Super!,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent",5
14719,Nice product,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11",4

Quality of product & finishings too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easy accessible.Light weight.

The quality of pictures taken from all rear cameras are very good.But not good results of front camera with compare of different brand.

And also thanks to flipkart for very fast delivery within two days.",4

Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3

Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

‚Ä¢The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.

‚Ä¢I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.

‚Ä¢The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.

4 out of 5 for this budget range.

Good build quality
Pros:
Definitely the battery. It's real good
Display looks good.
No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly
Back camera is good.

Cons:
Selfie camera could ve been better. As Mi phones offer good camera quality for this price range
No back cover. Even simple one.
High wattage battery, but atleast takes 2hours to full charge.",5
15028,Super!,Really amazing üëèüòçproduct I'm totally satisfied with it if anyone is willing to purchase a new phone I will recommend you to purchase I have also ordered another same product for my mother it's really nice u can rely on it value for money üí∞,5
15029,Worthless,it's not very good but battery is good processor is not very good so if we have to do gaming then it is not better for us,1
15030,Simply awesome,I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.,5
15031,Pretty good,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .,4
15032,Very poor,"Display is waste even less budget phones of other brands compared to this have good display.....camera says 48mp but trust me it's not even 8mp camera also.....speaker volume is less...... never expected this from a brand like samsung....... samsung manufacturers the display and supply to all other brands but Samsung itself should work on his phones rather....... totally bad experience.
Please go for any other brand......if u buy this phone simply u will not satisfy.",1

15036,Delightful,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
15037,Good choice,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

No lags. Yet to try high storage games. Handles 6 to 7 apps seamlessly

15258,Terrific purchase,"Bought this as a second phone. Was looking for a cheap reliable one. So went for a Samsung phone. Given the price, the display, call clarity and performance are good. Camera is also reasonably good. But then if camera was main function one needed, the budget would have to be stepped up. So overall, a very good phone for everyday use",5
15259,Nice product,Ph is looking good & camera is awesome but some features are missing as per the comparison of MI 9 PRIME & let me see in future how is it work ?,4
15260,Bad quality,"1. camera not clear like 48mp (May be it will be clear after update). But many features.
2. Smooth performance. Though Sometimes it slows down while multi-tasking in high speed. But it is quite natural for any phone. It has pop up. Split windows and many more. Amazing.
3. No hitting issue.


4. Battery lasts for 3 days in regular use.
5. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET.

üß∏ APP LOCK AND MORE SENSORS COULD BE GIVEN.",2

15266,Horrible,"Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people.",1

But you can't use this mobile for high level gaming like PUBG,BGMI and FREE FIRE. For gaming purchase Media Teck Helio G or P processor mobiles. I love this phoneüòá.

15276,Absolute rubbish!,"Like it's camera is is like 48mp.
It's take too much time to charge.
I recommend realme narzo 30a on place of this phone. Realme is better then samsung .
It's has very less features.
It doesn't have even Restrict background data . Or data speedo meter.
It's screenshot taking method is worst.
It's has soo many pre installed app that we could not delete.
I repete REALME IS BETTER THEN SAMSUNG.",1

Battery backup also less .",3
15280,Delightful,"Good phone. Camera quality, display is good. Gives good battery backup. Only and main problem is sound quality.

Every thing is fine but i don't like the camera quality , specially the front 8 MP selfie camera is not good and back camera is OK not bad .",4
15283,Nice,"Pocket friendly but not exactly pocket friendly. Other words it's great value for money but due to 6000mah battery it becomes think like 90s mobile phone. I think we don't need 6000mah battery as any way we are home in this lockdown. Apart from phone thickness everything is just awesome, perfect blend of memory, display and cpu. Awesome display. Samsung you rock always.",3

15292,Good choice,Overall performance is good for medium use. Battery life is pretty good. For those who's looking for playing High graphic games than don't go for it.

15293,Does the job,Display is ok ok..as compare to AMOLED screen.Other things like battery and hardware performance is perfect..4gb Ram and 128 gb is nice combination..Overall phone is good in this budget.,3
15294,Super!,"This is the best phone if you are looking for under 10000. It's performance is best. In some of the 4 gb ram mobile phone if you will open heavy games like cod mobile,free fire,etc and then go to the recent tab and open them they will restart but in this it doesn't restart. That's a good thing of it. It's camera is only a bad thing as there should be more modes for camera. However this phone is excellent",5
15295,Nice product,"Phone was delivered per time frame.....
If asking about the phone, best phone for the person who is Starting to get a touch of technology or for a light user
Best thing about the phone is the Samsung One UI
Its the twin brother of M12 > Same features ,there is no even a slight change
Other than that there is nothing else to post
If you want best value for money at this price range go for ""POCO""
Or you need a lesser priced samsung device go for M11",4
15296,Good choice,"I have never had a good experience with Samsung mobile before.So I always use a different brand of mobile.After reviewing of all good,the Samsung F12 galaxy was bought.

Quality of product & finishings too good in this price.Operating speed is excellent and easy accessible.Light weight.

The quality of pictures taken from all rear cameras are very good.But not good results of front camera with compare of different brand.

And also thanks to flipkart for very fast delivery within two days.",4
15297,Nice,"Everything is good about this product, except the weight of the phone, which is 220 grams without cover and around 250 gram with front protection glass and back cover, and thickness is almost 10mm and when you put a cover it increases and now its thick and heavy..so not at all a handy phone. Could have given 5000mah battery and weight it around 190 grams. Then it would have been a go to smartphone at this price.",3

Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.

Now with cons (there are multiple)
Display is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.
There is over brightness on display...

If you are gamer and love to play battle games then, this is the phone for you. It's beast in this price range.
